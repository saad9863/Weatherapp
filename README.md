# Weatherapp

This weather web application leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and visually appealing user interface. The HTML file structures the webpage, while the CSS file provides styling for a modern and responsive design. JavaScript is employed to fetch real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, dynamically updating the content based on user input. The integration of Firebase for web analytics showcases proficiency in incorporating external services for enhanced functionality and user interaction tracking. This project demonstrates skills in front-end web development, including UI/UX design, asynchronous JavaScript with fetch API, and integration of third-party services for added features. The use of version control, such as Git and GitHub, is also encouraged for collaborative development and code management
